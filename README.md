# UISG-Scoreboard
A digital scoreboard for high school use.

*Work is still in progress*

Work on:
========
* Dynamic homepage based on existing live events
* Design
* Incorporating several sports, i.e. basketball, volleyball
* Individual past event site
* Credits site
* Logo image file upload
* Add times/dates

What should work:
================
* View live/past events in real-time
* Login-secured admin section
* Create/delete live events
* Remote control live events
* Delete past events
* Create an account

Installation
============
*I hope I remember this correctly*
After cloning just
```
npm install
```
To setup the database locally create a directory `data` and start your mongo daemon through `mongod --dbpath ./data/`.
Optionally you can use a external database. By default I'm using my external DB at mLab. *Yes, not smart to share a password*
Don't forget to take a look at `app.js` and change the link to the database `var db = monk('some link');` optionally.

Also the creation of a new user is protected by default, for which reason at the first time you can should take out authentication for that site, to create a user to the database using the form.
Just temporarilyremove `isAuthenticated` in `routes/manager.js` for the `router.get('signup',...)` part.

Currently Working on: Adding volleyball game logic
==================================================
* Change socket.io responses in game.js
* Create conditions + respective logic in board.js & remote.js
* Adjust volleyball.jade
* Adapt creation of event in manager.js
* Adapt event creation form in createliveevent.jade
* Create dynamic jade form

* check game data with Mr. Ellmers

Steps for liveevents:
* Creating event: createliveevent.jade (X) -> manager.js (X) -> game.js
* Accessing event: liveevent.js -> sport.jade -> board.js <-> game.js
* Controlling event: manageliveevent.jade -> manager.js -> remote.jade + remote.js <-> game.js

Right now: -saving football game mechanism: button in remote that triggers saving (so that live event persists for a while)
		-remote.jade modularisieren
		-
